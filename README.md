# AUD13ND

An entry for js13kgames 2024. An audio sequencer game using web audio to create
sounds. As the beats are played from left to right, each row will create a
different sound. You must change note selections to avoid particles that will
attack each row from left and right. If you fail, the audio will <i>end</i> for
that beat. Survive all 13 levels to unlock full audio sequencer.

## Gloop

This game is built with a tiny game loop framework called "Gloop". Files are
included directly here in the "src" for my convenience, but i wrote it too.

## Inspiration

The core idea for this game came from the amazing acid defender prototype.
